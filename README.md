SkinSpatial is a repository for the code to analyse skin spatial data. Here we host an official version and development of STRISH (Spatial Transcriptomic and RNA In-situ Hybridization) pipeline. 

# STRISH pipeline documentation 

STRISH is a computational pipeline that enables us to quantitatively model cell-cell interactions by automatically scanning for local expression of RNAscope data to recapitulate an interaction landscape across the whole tissue.
