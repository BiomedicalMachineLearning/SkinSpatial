SkinSpatial is a repository for the code to analyse skin spatial data. Here we host an official version and development of STRISH (Spatial Transcriptomic and RNA In-situ Hybridization) pipeline. 

# STRISH pipeline documentation 

STRISH is a computational pipeline that enables us to quantitatively model cell-cell interactions by automatically scanning for local expression of RNAscope data to recapitulate an interaction landscape across the whole tissue.

1. To process RNAScope data, see the Ipynb at [STRISH/Python_pipeline]()
2. To run the cell detection pipeline copy the groovy files froom [STRISH/QuPath_pipelines]()
3. For details about image resgistration, see the Ipynb at [STRISH/Python_pipeline]()
4. For details about cell-cell interation analysis with Visium data, visit stLearn page at [stLearn]() 

## Examples of STRISH analysis of RNASCope data:
